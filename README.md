# RandomTable Parser Class
A parser class for randomizing tables

This parser uses a format developed by Dr. J.M. "Thijs" Krijger <matthijs.krijger@gmail.com>.
The parser and documentation is written by Niklas Sch√∂nberg <niko@uplink.fi> and released under the GPL.

## Usage
The class is used with a text string containing the tables (see format.md). The string can be given as the first argument in the constructor, and/or with the populate() method.

A result can then be generated by using the generate() method. This returns the generated result as a string.

## The Methods

### __construct([rawData[,dataSetName]])

The rawData is the table definition you wish to use. It's optional, but must be given at some point before generate() can be used. dataSetName is an optional name given for the data set, this is used with include instructions so that the parser can keep track of which data sets you have included.

### populate(rawData[,dataSetName[,reset=false]])

This work in very much the same way as the constructor for rawData and dataSetName. The additional reset attribute is used to empty all previously included data sets and start from scratch.

### getInclude()

Returns an array containing all records currently in the include stack. The stack is populated by "@dataSetName" instructions in a data set.

### popInclude()

Returns one record from the include stack, and removes it from the stack.
